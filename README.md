# GoLang Fyne

## Fyne installation setup :
what do we need :
A C complier cause the fyne compiles our gui program in C. Make sure golang, compiler and the app you're programming are on the same drive.

1. Install golang.
2. I used TDM gcc compiler. Just install and follow the wizard steps to create.

### terminal commands (in your code editor) :
`go mod init myapp(any name you want)`

`go get fyne.io/fyne/v2`

`go get fyne.io/fyne/v2@latest`

and just to run `go run [your file name :) ]`
